## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1. User Interface

#### Username/Email Field:
- A field where users can input their registered email or username.
- Should be clearly labeled.

#### Password Field:

- The login screen should be easy to understand and use, even for first-time users.

#### Responsive Design:
- The login screen should render appropriately on devices of different sizes and resolutions.

### 3.2. Performance

#### Fast Authentication:
- The login process should be quick, with minimal waiting time for the user.

#### Optimized API Calls:
- Ensure that API calls are optimized to minimize data usage and enhance speed.

### 3.4. Accessibility

#### Contrast:
- Text and background colors should have high contrast for visibility.

- Users should be able to navigate the login screen using a keyboard.

### 3.5. Scalability

#### API Scalability:
- Ensure the app can handle a large number of simultaneous login requests as user numbers grow.

### 3.6. Maintainability

#### Modular Design:
- The login screen's code should be modular and well-documented, allowing for easy updates or modifications in the future.

#### Error Logs:
- Maintain logs of any failed login attempts or issues for debugging purposes.
